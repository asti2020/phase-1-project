            This is the best anime I have ever watched. Everything in the story-line is on point,
            kick ass action and emotional scenes that can make any tough guy cry.
            This is a show that can be enjoyed by people of all age groups. And this is coming from a hardcore anime fan.
            The emotional factor here is spot on and will let you take on life with a different perspective.
            If I were to describe it in one sentence, I would say "It's LIFE CHANGING". <br>

            The show is entertaining all the way to the end. With moments to laugh about.
            But all lessons have a meaning behind it, and it all builds up to the last chapter,
            which will make sense of all the 11 episodes. Brilliant!
            Ps. I freaking cried towards the end of episode 12! <br>

        <p class="content-review">The story is still really simple. It doesn’t have a complicated storyline and there’s not even a plot.
            Though that is the case, it’s still not boring at all.
            In a way that is very admirable because I honestly think it is very hard to make a series interesting if the story is very simple.
            It is also a lot funnier. The gags and punch lines are a lot cleaner.
            There’s even a bit of drama as well and in fairness, it is nicely done.
