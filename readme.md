## Start Up the Server
All of the animes details are from public API
Root to the API: "https://api.jikan.moe/v3/search/anime?q=naruto"
to get all the data we have to get the data by fatch request

After fork and clone from gitHub open "index.html" file in the terminal
Our most of the style is in the "style.css" file
We have populated most of the html elements with javascript,
we have included the Get method :
                    Array iletration methods :  ForEach, filter
                    events are : click, submit, mouseover, mouseout

### Conclusion
Anime is a growing multi billion dollar industry that many people have grown to love and use as a form of entertainment, we design a web app that can be used as a channel to express viewers opinions, this was done using events listeners, Array iletration methods and manipulate the DOM in response. Here we have created the our first project.
