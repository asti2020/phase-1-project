# Introduction
Welcome to The Anime Gallery!!
we have created the small web app to render the animes from the public api.
All data are from the data by fatch request

Our most of the style is in the "style.css" file
We have populated most of the html elements with javascript,
we have included the Get method :
                    Array iletration methods :  ForEach, filter
                    events are : click, submit, mouseover, mouseout


## Users,
In this app we provide a variety of the top anime titles and synopsis,
we can click the nav bar and filter content between shows, movies and specials on the webpage,
and if you have seen it, review it! your reviews will be displayed on the web page for others to view!

## Team
Astika Luintel Kriti
Christian Cedeno

### Conclusion
Anime is a growing multi billion dollar industry that many people have grown to love and use as a form of entertainment, we design a web app that can be used as a channel to express viewers opinions, this was done using events listeners, Array iletration methods and manipulate the DOM in response. Here we have created the our first project.


Thank You!
